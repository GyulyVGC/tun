# Firewall rules
# Rules preceded by '+' have higher priority (quick rules)

IN ACCEPT --dport 22
IN ACCEPT --proto 1 --icmp-type 8
IN ACCEPT --dport 3000,3001

# ------------------------------
# I should add a rule to ACCEPT iperf traffic while NOT logging it, something like:
# IN ACCEPT --dport 5001 --no-log
# ...so in practice a new option '--no-log' is needed for nullnet-firewall rules
